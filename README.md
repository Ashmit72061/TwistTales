# TwistTales

> A collaborative storytelling game where players create chaotic, fun short stories‚Äîone twist at a time.

---

## üß† Project Description

**TwistTales** is a web-based multiplayer storytelling game where creativity meets chaos. Players are given a story prompt (pretext) and asked to write exactly 100 words. However, the twist is: the next player only sees **the last sentence** of the previous story and continues from there. Once all players have contributed, the full story is revealed‚Äîoften bizarre, hilarious, and unexpectedly delightful.
